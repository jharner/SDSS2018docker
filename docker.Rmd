## Docker

Docker containers are becoming essential for software development and for the deployment of complex computing environments. This talk presents three Docker solutions to address these and other use cases relevant to statisticians and data scientists.

- Rocker: a suite of R-based Docker images built by and hosted on Docker Hab

- RSpark: a suite of Spark-based Docker images hosted on Docker Hub

- Rc$^2$: a graphical frontend and environment for running R in contaners

Perhaps the most important reason for using Docker by statisticians and data scientists is the complexity of their computing environments, e.g., aligning version numbers for R and its packages, drivers, SQL and NoSQL databases, Hadoop, Spark and its packages, etc.

## What is Docker?

Docker allows developers, devops, and sysadmins to **develop**, **deploy**, and **run** applications using containers. We call this **containerization**.

Containers are:

* Flexible  
* Lightweight  
* Portable  
* Scalable

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. A container runs as a discrete process and thus its memory requirements are nearly equivalent to other executables, i.e., it is lightweight. On the other hand, a virtual machine runs a guest OS which is built on a hypervisor, through which host resources are accessed. Running multiple VMs is very heavy. 

## Images and Containers

The two principal Docker entities are:

* Image: an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application  
* Container: a runtime instance of an image

The image contains the code, configuration files, environmental variables, libraries, and the runtime. You can see the images by running:
```
docker images
```
A comtainer is an image with state, i.e., a user process. You can view the running containers by executing:
```
docker ps
```
You can run an image by:
```
docker run hello-world
```
or run rstudio by:
```
sudo docker run -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=<PICK-A-PASSWORD> rocker/rstudio
```

## A Modern Data Science Platform

## Rocker Project

Rocker project: a widely-used suite of Docker images with customized R environments for particular tasks.

Currently, there are 17 repos in [rocker-org](https://github.com/rocker-org).

The most important to us are:  

* [rocker-versioned](https://github.com/rocker-org)
    + r-ver: versioned base R  
    + rstudio: adds rstudio  
    + tidyverse: adds tidyverse and devtools   
    + verse: adds tex and publishing packages    
* shiny  
* ml  

## RSpark Project

RSpark is a GiTHub project with images stored on Doctor Hub. The current containers for RSpark are:

- rstudio: main contaner with R, RStudio, and a single node version of Spark (depends on hadoop and hive)

- postgres: container with PostgresSQL

- hadoop: conatianer with HDFS, MapReduce, etc.

- hive: container with the Hive data warehouse (depends on hadoop)

- spark: a master container and two or more worker containers (depending on the master)

Images are built with a Dockerfile. The `docker-compose` file controls the builds and the relationships among the containers.

For details of the Dockerfile for each of the containers see jharner/rspark on github.com.

## Rc$^2$ Project

Rc$^2$ is a GitHub project. The current server-side containers are:

- App Server: communicates with the client, the Compute Server, and the Database server

- Compute Server: runs R and communicate with the App Server and the Database Server

- Database Server: hosts a PostgreSQL database
